# thealphascript
a completely normal alpha minecraft experience in newer versions for better performance

the alpha script is an alpha experience modpack where absolutely nothing happens. nothing. there is nothing to be worried about. there are no encounters. no anomalies. no entities.

this is a purely alpha experience on modern versions of minecraft, making it accessible for everyone. the pack is very lightweight, this could run on any machine.

some users have reported out of the ordinary encounters with unreleased enemies, distorted soundtracks, the sky having issues or buildings appearing where they weren't before. it is best advised to be wary of such anomalies with our alpha release version, remember, don't stare directly at the bugs.

if you wish to play with friends (and others.) simply open to lan as you would normally and you will be given a link for your friends to join.

ideally do NOT mess with any of the configs or settings, they are important for the experience.
incase you wish to decrease the VHS screen effect, type the command /removevhs
incase you wish to stop catastrophic events, type the command /safemode
incase you have a weak heart, stay far, far away
incase you have a weakness towards psychological horror, stay even further away
